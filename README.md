## Quickly add your homework to [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

This small tool allows you to add Things task signifficantly faster.
This works by generating a Link with the Things protocol. You may have to enable this option in the Things settings.

[Link Builder](https://culturedcode.com/things/support/articles/2803573/)

## Note:
My version adds the task in the "Hausaufgaben" List, if you wanna change this, just edit the list value in ``components/LinkGenerator.tsx``.

To change the subjects, take a look at ``lib/subjects.ts``.

Note: This is a sort of "fork it and edit it to fit your personal needs project".
